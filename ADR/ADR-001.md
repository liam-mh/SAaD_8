# ADR 001: Choice of Database – Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server

## Status
**Status:** Approved

## Context and Problem Statement
Our team needs to select a cloud database that aligns with the project requirements for scalability, performance, and reliability. We are specifically evaluating cloud-based MySQL options to support our application because of MySQL’s wide use in professional settings. The key challenge is to choose the most optimal MySQL cloud database from the many options available.

## Decision Drivers
The decision drivers for choosing the most appropriate MySQL cloud database include:
- **Cost-effectiveness**: The service must offer flexible pricing models that can scale with the application's needs while keeping the overall cost manageable. In our context, we are looking for the most cost-effective solution for students, specifically the best free/student pricing.
- **Performance**: We need a database that ensures high availability, low latency, and scalability as application traffic grows.
- **Managed service**: We would prefer a managed solution to offload operational complexity, including backup, maintenance, patching, and security updates.
- **Availability and resilience**: Our system requires a highly available database with disaster recovery capabilities that can operate across different zones or regions.

## Options Considered
1. Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server
2. AWS RDS for MySQL
3. Google Cloud SQL for MySQL
4. Oracle Cloud

## Decision Outcome
We decided to go with **Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server** as our choice of cloud-based MySQL database solution.

## Consequences
- Our reliance on Azure-specific features may make it difficult to move to another cloud provider, as equivalent features may not exist or function differently.
- While Azure provides automatically scaling features, ensuring we only pay for what we use, costs may rise significantly as our database expands.
- We will not be able to use Oracle Cloud’s always-free resources; however, Azure’s database offers a simpler setup and additional features.

## Confirmation
Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server meets all our key decision drivers, especially with its automated backups and auto-scaling IOPS supporting our need for performance. Using Azure will also allow seamless integration with our program if we use Azure App Services to host it.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
- Flexible cost options, auto-scaling IOPS and storage means we are only charged for what we use.
- Control over maintenance windows.
- High availability with zone redundancy options.
- Built-in managed services such as automated backups and patching.
- Native integration with other Azure services (e.g., Azure App Services).

### Cons
- As our database grows in size, the cost will increase significantly.
- Due to the database’s integration with other Azure components, we may become locked into Azure’s cloud, complicating future migrations.
- We may also be limited in adopting a multi-cloud strategy if we need services from another provider such as AWS.
