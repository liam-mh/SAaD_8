# ADR-002: Payment Tiers for Media Rentals

## Status
**Status:** Proposed

## Context and Problem Statement
The Advanced Media Library (AML) aims to introduce a subscription-based model for media rentals. Users will pay a monthly fee and receive a specified number of credits. These credits can be used to rent media items for a set duration. The goal is to provide a flexible and affordable way for users to access AML's extensive collection.

## Decision Drivers
The decision drivers for choosing the most appropriate solution include:
- **User Experience**: The subscription model should be easy to understand and use, offering a seamless experience for members.
- **Revenue Generation**: The subscription model should generate a predictable and sustainable revenue stream for AML.
- **Fairness**: The pricing structure should be fair and equitable for all users, regardless of their usage patterns.

## Options Considered
- **Flat-Rate Subscription**: Users pay a fixed monthly fee and have unlimited access to media rentals.
- **Tiered Subscription**: Users choose from multiple subscription tiers, each offering a different number of credits per month.
- **Pay-As-You-Go**: Users pay per rental, without a subscription.
- **Hybrid Model**: A combination of subscription and pay-as-you-go options.

## Decision Outcome
- **Decision**: Tiered Subscription
- **Reasoning**: A tiered subscription model offers the best balance between user experience, revenue generation, and fairness. It provides flexibility for users to choose a plan that aligns with their usage patterns, while also ensuring a predictable income stream for AML.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Provides users with a choice of subscription plans.
  - Generates a more predictable revenue stream.
  - Encourages consistent usage.
- **Negative**:
  - May require more complex billing and account management.
  - Could potentially lead to unused credits.
  ## Mitigation Strategy
  - To minimize the potential downsides, we will implement measures such as a notificatoin for users about their credits if they are low, and an easy-to-use interface to track usage. Additionally, we will regularly review usage patterns and feedback to adjust the tier offerings as needed.

## Confirmation
The effectiveness of the tiered subscription model will be evaluated based on user satisfaction, subscription rates, and revenue generation. Regular analysis and feedback from users will inform future adjustments to the pricing structure.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
- **Flexibility**: Users can choose a plan that suits their needs.
- **Predictability**: AML has a more stable revenue stream.
- **Fairness**: Users pay based on their usage.

### Cons
- **Complexity**: Implementing multiple tiers can be more complex.
- **Unused Credits**: Users might not fully utilize their credits.

## Additional Considerations:
